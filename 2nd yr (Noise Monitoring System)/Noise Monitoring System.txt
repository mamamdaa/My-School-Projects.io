Noise Monitoring System

This project desires to maintain quietness and peace inside the library by measuring the 
level of noise.

Noise monitoring system is simply a device with microphone sound sensor that is 
controlled by Arduino Uno, which is an open-source microcontroller board. This project 
focuses on measuring the various sound levels present in a library. The microphone sound 
sensor detects sound. It gives a measurement of how loud a sound is. Microphone sensor will
 detect the sound intensity of surroundings and will light up an LED based on the sound leve
l detected if it reach the max level the buzzer will turn on and a warning sign will print 
in LCD.
